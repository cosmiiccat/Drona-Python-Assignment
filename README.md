# Drona Python Assignment

## Problem 1: Simulated Drone Movement System

### Introduction
This Python program simulates the movement of a drone using the Turtle module. The drone can move in four directions: forward, backward, left, and right.

### Files
- **Q1.py**: Main program for simulating drone movement.
- **config.py**: Configuration file containing settings for drone speed, color, shape, distance, and angle.

### Instructions
1. Run the program.
2. Use the following keys to control the drone:
   - "w" for forward
   - "s" for backward
   - "a" for left
   - "d" for right
3. Close the program when done.

## Problem 2: TCP Socket Communication

### Introduction
This set of Python programs facilitates communication between a sender and a receiver using TCP sockets.

### Files
- **sender.py**: Program for sending messages to the receiver.
- **receiver.py**: Program for accepting incoming connections and displaying received messages.
- **config.py**: Configuration file containing settings for message size, host, and port.
- **init.py**: Initialization file containing socket setup.

### Instructions
1. Run the receiver program first.
2. Run the sender program.
3. Enter messages in the sender program.
4. View received messages in the receiver program.

### Error Handling
Both sender and receiver programs implement error handling for socket operations to ensure robust communication.

## Repository Organization

### Naming Convention
- Organize Python files within the repository using the following naming convention:
  - Q1.py for the drone movement simulation.
  - sender.py and receiver.py for the TCP socket communication.

### Documentation
1. **README.md**: Main documentation file providing an overview of the assignment and instructions for running the programs.
2. **Screenshots**: Output screenshots for each problem statement, named according to the corresponding problem statements (e.g., Q1_Output.png, Q2_Output.png).

## How to Run

### Problem 1
1. Execute Q1.py.
2. Use the specified keys to control the simulated drone.
3. Close the program when finished.

### Problem 2
1. Run receiver.py first.
2. Run sender.py.
3. Enter messages in the sender console.
4. View received messages in the receiver console.

Note: Ensure that the configurations in config.py are appropriately set.
